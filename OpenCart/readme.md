Triage and prioritization: Assigning severity and priority levels, assigning defects to appropriate team members.
Tracking tools: Defect tracking software or project management tool.
Roles and responsibilities: Testers, developers, test lead, etc.
Communication channels: Updating stakeholders on progress and status of defects.
Metrics: Number of defects found, time taken to resolve, percentage of defects fixed.

7. Test Strategy

Step 1: Test scenarios and test cases creation: Techniques: Equivalence Class Partition, Boundary Value Analysis, Decision Table Testing, Use Case Testing. Additional methods: Error Guessing, Exploratory Testing.
Step 2: Testing procedure:
Smoke Testing: To check critical functionalities (e.g., form submission).
In-depth Testing: Using created test cases after stable build passes Smoke Testing.
Multiple environments: Simultaneous testing on multiple supported environments.
Defect Reporting: Logging bugs in the tracking tool, daily status emails.
Types of Testing: Smoke Testing, Sanity Testing, Regression Testing, Usability Testing, Functionality & UI Testing.


Step 3: Best Practices:
Context Driven Testing: Testing as per the application's context.
Shift Left Testing: Early testing from the development stages.
Exploratory Testing: Apart from normal test case execution.
End to End Flow Testing: Simulating user flows for registration and login.
